  <h2>about</h2>
  <p>
    I am a very passionate programmer. I am also the CEO of a Micro ISV called 
    <a href="http://cosmicvent.com" title='Cosmicvent Software'>Cosmicvent Software</a>.
    I have been in the software industry for more than 4 years. You can shoot me an email at 
    <strong><a href='mailto:minhajuddin.k@gmail.com' title='email me'>minhajuddin.k@gmail.com</a></strong> or send a tweet to
    <a href='http://twitter.com/minhajuddin' title='minhajuddin on twitter'>@minhajuddin</a>.

    I try to blog about things I find new and interesting. And I am sure I'll never run out of 
    new things, that's what's exciting about the software industry :)
    I have been trying out new things since the day I joined the software industry.
    I have worked with technologies and processes as diverse as <em>Data Warehousing</em> and <em>Live Vehicle tracking</em>.
    These days I am dabbling a lot in ruby and all the nice web frameworks that come with it, like <em>Rails</em>, <em>Sinatra</em>, and 
    <em>Rack</em>.
