    This is a simple framework which allows for writing of simple javascript calculators to calculate things like network / broadcast addresses from ip and subnet.
    The code for this is available on github at <a href='http://github.com/minhajuddin/calc'>http://github.com/minhajuddin/calc</a>.To contribute to the 
    site just fork the git repository and your calculator and send me a pull request.
